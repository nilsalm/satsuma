# 🍊 Satsuma - the helpful shopping list

> Are you adding the same staples to you shopping list week after week? There should be a template function for this!
>
> Are you wandering back and forth in the supermarket because the things on your list are not group by section? That shouldn't be too hard.
>
> Are frustrated with how many clicks it can take to add an item to a list or how hard it is to invite your partner to share the same list?
>
> Relax, have a satsuma and enjoy the next trip to the supermarket.
>
> 🍊

That's at least the vision for this little helper app.
